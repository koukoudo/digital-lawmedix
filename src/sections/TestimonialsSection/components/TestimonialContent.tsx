          At Mokhetle Attorneys Inc., we have had the privilege of referring
          clients to Prof. Kenneth Segwapa&#39;s practice for medico-legal
          assessments, and his medico-legal reports are consistently
          outstanding. Having reviewed a large number of his reports, I found no
          errors, not even typos. One can deduce from his medico-legal writing
          that he pays close attention to his area of expertise and avoids
          &#39;cut-and-paste&#39; practices, which demonstrates his meticulous
          approach to plastic surgery and distinguishes him from others.

          What truly sets Prof. Segwapa apart is his unwavering commitment to
          ethical practice. He does not believe in a one-size-fits-all solution;
          instead, he takes the time to understand each patient&#39;s individual
          needs. Unlike many in his field, he prioritizes clients over profit.
          Our law firm refers between three and four clients per month to Prof.
          Segwapa&#39;s practice for medico-legal reports, and our professional
          relationship spans over ten years. He is an expert who not only
          produces thorough medico-legal reports but is also always prepared to
          appear in trials and defend his findings when required.

          If you are seeking a plastic surgeon who values precision, integrity,
          and excellence, Prof. Segwapa is second to none. - E. Mokhetle
